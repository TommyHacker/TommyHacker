Hello you there, Tom Hacker here. 

Just wanted to say...
It's strange how some pixels are different in colour to others and now the mass of meat inside your head is creating the exact same meaning that i did in the past while writing this.
<br  />
<br />
Oh, and on the subject of leveraging "AI" (It is not AI) to 100x and even replace your developers?
<br/>
If you the applications will just keep working, as is, after the developers are gone... PLEASE can you livestream the next few weeks at your company as they unfold?
<br />
<br  />
QUICK! to my weebly! -> [http://tomhacker.weebly.generous-free-tier.biz](https://tomhacker.com)
<br />
<br  />
If you, or someone you love, knows how i can get a .gov domain please let me know. 
<br />

I hope you can find some contact details through my website. Otherwise im going to have to scrum my agile UI/UX waterfall into figma with my ragecoin gulping bit-bucket again just to achieve an elastic beanstalk!.
